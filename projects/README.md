# Welcome to Projects of MMPose

In this folder, we welcome all contribution of keypoint detection techniques from community.

Here, these requirements, e.g. code standards, are not as strict as in the core package. Thus, developers from the community can implement their algorithms much more easily and efficiently in MMPose. We appreciate all contributions from the community that makes MMPose greater.

Here is an [example project](./example_project) about how to add your algorithms easily. For common questions about projects, please read our [faq](faq.md).

We also provide some documentation listed below:

- [New Model Guide](https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/migration.html#step3-model)

  The documentation of adding new models.

- [Contribution Guide](https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/notes/contribution_guide.html)

  The guides for new contributors about how to add your projects to MMPose.

- [Discussions](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/discussions)

  Welcome to start a discussion!
